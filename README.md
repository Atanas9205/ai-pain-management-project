## 📖 Abstract

In this project, I developed a reproducible workflow for classifying pain levels using affordable physiological signals. Since no suitable public dataset was available, I created a synthetic dataset with realistic ranges for electrodermal activity (EDA – Electrodermal Activity), heart rate (HR – Heart Rate), skin temperature, cortisol levels, a simple condition variable, and a target pain level (low, moderate, high).

The data were split using a grouped strategy to avoid information leakage between subjects. I tested several baseline models – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM with RBF kernel (Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel), and a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP – Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network) – all implemented through scikit-learn pipelines with preprocessing steps like imputation and scaling. Model performance was measured with common multi-class metrics (macro F1, accuracy) and ranking metrics (micro ROC-AUC – Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve, micro average precision).

On this synthetic dataset, Logistic Regression provided the most stable balance between precision and recall, making it a reasonable starting point due to its simplicity and interpretability. The current version focuses on clarity and reproducibility, with future improvements planned for using real-world data, better calibration, and fairness checks across different conditions.

## Introduction

Pain is not just a symptom – it is a constant companion that can deeply affect the daily lives of people living with neurodegenerative diseases. For someone with Multiple Sclerosis (MS – Multiple Sclerosis), even a short walk can feel exhausting. For those with Parkinson's Disease (PD – Parkinson's Disease), stiffness and discomfort can overshadow moments of clarity. And for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS – Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), pain might remain in the background, but it is just as exhausting as the more visible symptoms.

Despite medical advances, the assessment of pain still relies heavily on patient self-reporting. This method has limitations – some patients struggle to describe their sensations, and pain itself changes in intensity and character over time. In conditions that affect movement, cognition, and emotions, this makes the job of clinicians even more challenging.

In this project, I propose a more objective approach. By collecting different types of data – physiological signals, hormone levels, and patient-reported information – and applying machine learning (ML – Machine Learning) algorithms, we can build a system that more accurately detects pain levels. This approach listens not only to what patients say, but also to what their bodies reveal.

I believe that this method can change the way pain is tracked in neurodegenerative diseases – shifting from a reactive to a preventive approach, ultimately helping improve patients' quality of life.

## Data

Due to privacy and legal constraints (GDPR), we cannot use real-world patient data.  
This project therefore relies on a **synthetic dataset** to demonstrate the full end-to-end machine learning pipeline.  
This approach ensures reproducibility and allows the model to be developed safely.

[`AI_Based_Physical_Pain_Management_in_Neurodegenerative_Disorders.ipynb`](AI_Based_Physical_Pain_Management_in_Neurodegenerative_Disorders.ipynb) notebook.
